Compiler Construction labs:

The descriptions, and percentages are made up by me. The three labs are worth 45% so it's my prediction.

1. Project 1 (15%): Lexical analysis, Top-down syntax analysis in HACS (v0.9.0)
2. Project 2a (10%): Outling Syntax-directed translation (SDT), Name analysis, Type analysis
3. Project 2b (5%): Implementing 2a into HACS (v0.9.5)
4. Project 3 (15%): Direct code generator - ARM32 assembly subset
