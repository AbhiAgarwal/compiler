\section{2.1 Definition}

\par We say that a type $t_1$ is assignment compatible to a type $t_2$ if a variable or member of type $t_2$ can be assigned a value of type $t_1$. In JST, every type is assignment compatible with any, and every type is assignment compatible with itself.

\par Lets consider an example to solidify our point here. We have a declaration of a variable: \texttt{string name = `abhi"}.
